          I'm Shubhanshu, a freelance UI/UX designer
          based in India.I craft accessible websites for
          brands using tech for good. <br /><br />
          
          At 20, I'm already knee-deep in the world of B.Tech in Computer Science, fueled by an insatiable curiosity for turning complex problems into elegant solutions. My journey is not just about textbooks; it's a hands-on exploration of the boundless possibilities within the realm of computer science. <br /><br />

          Diving beyond the theoretical, my portfolio showcases a collection of projects that go beyond classroom assignments. From web development to my other profession, each project is a testament to my commitment to practical learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
